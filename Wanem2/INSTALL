Installation Instructions

You must have the apache web server and mod_php installed on your netem
machine. 

You must also have netem working correctly on your machine with support
available in the kernel and a recent version of iproute2 installed.

You need to have sudo installed and working on your machine. 
Sudo has a configuration file which can be edited using the 'visudo'
command. The following line will be added:

%www-data         ALL=NOPASSWD: /sbin/tc, /bin/echo, /bin/mv, /bin/grep, /root/disc_new_port_int/disconnect.sh, /root/disc_new_port_int/check_disco.sh, /root/disc_new_port_int/reset_disc.sh, /usr/sbin/conntrack, /root/wanalyzer/tcs_wanc_menu.sh, /root/wanalyzer/tcs_wanem_main.sh%www-data  ALL=NOPASSWD: /sbin/tc, /bin/echo, /bin/mv, /bin/grep, /root/disc_new_port_int/disconnect.sh, /root/disc_new_port_int/check_disco.sh, /root/disc_new_port_int/reset_disc.sh, /usr/sbin/conntrack, /root/wanalyzer/tcs_wanc_menu.sh, /root/wanalyzer/tcs_wanem_main.sh

Username can be "www-data" or "apache".
Change it to the appropriate user if it is not.

The file, 'config.inc.php' is a small configuration file for the
program. You can change the location of the commands used by the 
program and the location that it temporarily stores the on/off status 
and the last set of commands that were run.  This location must be 
read/writeable by all users, /tmp is a good example.
