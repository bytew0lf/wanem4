WANem4 is an intuitive browser based GUI for the netem network emulation tools of Linux.

Why WANem**4**?
WANem4 is a revival of the WANem wide area network emulator aiming for standalone installation.
Based on 
* WANem2 project - http://wanem2.sourceforge.net/
* WANem project - http://wanem.sourceforge.net/
* PHPNetemGUI - http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpnetemgui/
* PHPNetemGUI2 - http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpnetemgui2/

The original WANem released up through a beta of version 3 in live cd and virtual appliance formats.
WANem2 was a project to extract the relevant bits and update to PHP5.6 and it released a version 1.

The lowest number that was absolutely unused by anyone: 4.  So, here we are with the next generation of work on the project.
